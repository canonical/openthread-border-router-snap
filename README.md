sudo snap connect openthread-border-router:system-etc-sysctl

# Allow DNS-SD registration and discovery
sudo snap connect openthread-border-router:avahi-control
# Allow setting up the firewall
sudo snap connect openthread-border-router:firewall-control
# Allow access to USB Thread Radio Co-Processor (RCP)
sudo snap connect openthread-border-router:raw-usb
# Allow setting up the networking
sudo snap connect openthread-border-router:network-control
# Allow controlling the Bluetooth devices
sudo snap connect openthread-border-router:bluetooth-control
# Allow device discovery over Bluetooth Low Energy
sudo snap connect openthread-border-router:bluez
```

## Run

## Usage

### Control a Matter Thread device
To commission and control a Matter Thread device via the OTBR Snap, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/canonical/openthread-border-router-snap/wiki/Commission-and-control-a-Matter-Thread-device-via-the-OTBR-Snap).

### Pre-Shared Key for the Commissioner (PSKc) generator

To authenticate an external Thread Commissioner to a Thread network:

```bash
openthread-border-router.pskc J01NME 1234AAAA1234BBBB MyOTBRNetwork
```

where:

- `J01NME` is the passphrase/commissioner credential. It is a user-defined string encoded in UTF-8 and should be between 6 and 255 characters long.
- `1234AAAA1234BBBB` is the Extended PAN ID that was used in the operational dataset when forming the OTBR network.
- `MyOTBRNetwork` is the Network Name that was used in the operational dataset when forming the OTBR network.

### Steering data generator

To generate a hash of the set of Joiners intended for commissioning:

```bash
openthread-border-router.steering-data 8 0000b57fffe15d68
```

where:

- `8` is the Byte length of steering data (optional, default is 16).
- `0000b57fffe15d68` is the Joiner ID (EUI-64).
